<p><i><b>
    Some Interesting Facts about Cicada</b> </i></p>
<ol>
  <li>  Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li> 
  <li>   Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li> 
  <li>  Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools.</li>
